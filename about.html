  <p>
    Hi! I'm a former special education teacher turned aspiring software developer.  
    I started my coding journey in June 2026 with the #100Devs challenge, eager to build new skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
    My passion is creating meaningful projects that combine creativity and problem-solving.  
    Follow along as I learn, build, and share my growth in tech!
